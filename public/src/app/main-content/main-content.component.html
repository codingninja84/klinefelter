          <p>Jill Klinefelter has been our family insurance agent for the past 7 years. She has always taken the time to understand our familyâ€™s needs. It is so nice to know that when we need something, she will be there to help. I never have to worry about getting ahold of her or her staff. They are fast, friendly and professional.</p>
